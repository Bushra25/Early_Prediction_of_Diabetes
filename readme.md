# <p style="text-align:center;"> Early Prediction of Diabetes</p> 


### Background
**Diabetes** is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.


### Problem Statement:
Diabetes is one of the deadliest diseases in the world. It is not only a disease but also creator of different kinds of diseases like heart attack, blindness etc. And Saudi Arabia was ranked as the 7th highest country in the world with diabetes. IHME estimated the costs in 2014 were 17 billion SR, expected to increase to 27 billion SR incase undiagnosed people are documented, and 43 billion SR if pre-diabetics become diabetics. The normal identifying process is that patients need to visit a diagnostic center, consult their doctor, and sit tight for a day or more to get their reports.



### Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning Classification model to predict whether or not the patient has diabetes or not based on certain diagnostic measurements.



### Dataset Used: 
* The population for this study was the Pima Indian population near Phoenix, Arizona. 
* The population has been under continuous study since 1965 by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) because of its high incidence rate of diabetes.
* This dataset is originally from the NIDDK, and it is credited to UCI Machine Learning Repository.
* All patients in this dataset are Females of at least 21 years of age. 


### Features Description:
* **The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable:**
<ol>
  <li>**Outcome:** Class Variable (0 or 1) where '0' denotes patient is not having diabetes and '1' denotes patient having diabetes..</li>
</ol>

 
* **Predictor variables includes:**
<ol>
  <li>**Pregnancies:** Number of times the patient got pregnant.</li>
  <li>**Glucose:** Plasma Glucose Concentration a 2 hour in an oral glucose tolerance test (mg/dl)
* Normal: Below 140 mg/dl
* Prediabetes: 140 to 199 mg/dl
* Diabetes: 200 mg/dl or more
A 2-hour value between 140 and 200 mg/dl is called impaired glucose tolerance. This is called "pre-diabetes", it means you are at increased risk of developing diabetes over time. A glucose level of 200 mg/dl or higher is used to diagnose diabetes.</li>
  <li>**BloodPressure: Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)**
If Diastolic B.P over 90 means High B.P (High Probability of Diabetes), Diastolic B.P below 60 means Low B.P (Less Probability of Diabetes) </li>
  <li>**SkinThickness: Triceps Skin Fold Thickness (mm)-**
A value used to estimate body fat. Normal Triceps Skinfold Thickness in women is 23mm. Higher thickness leads to obesity and chances of diabetes increases.</li>
  <li>**Insulin: 3-Hour Serum Insulin (mlU/L)**
Normal Insulin Level is between 16-166 mlU/L. Values above this range can be alarming.</li>
  <li> **BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/ height in m)**
Body Mass Index of 18.5 to 25 is within the normal range. BMI between 25 and 30 then it falls within the overweight range. A BMI of 30 or over falls within the obese range.</li>
  <li>**DiabetesPedigreeFunction:**
It provides information about history in relatives and genetic relationship of those relatives with patients. Higher Pedigree Function means patient is more likely to have diabetes.</li>
  <li>**Age:** (in years)</li>
</ol>
